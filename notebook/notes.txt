the distribution of a fft of random noise is:a

Gaussianness is preserved and F_w propto N(0, sigma^2). 

"the variance of the noise in the frequency domain is 2pi sigma)^-2"

the distribution of power of fft of random noise (periodogram) is the distribution of the square of a gaussian noise, 
thus:

distribution I(nu_j) propto X_2^2 * sigma^2/2. 

(chi-square distribution of two degrees of freedom). 

Now we may ask what is the distribution of the _maximum_ of a sample of N chi_square distributions

Modelling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance

We start by showing that 

max_i=1,...K X_i  is distributed as sum (X_i/i). 

which is itself Chi_square distributed as chi_square with 2*i dof (and almost normal). But that does not tell the distribution

The chi-square with 2 degrees of freedoms is the same as the exponential distribution. 

Expections are d^n M(t) /dt^2 with M(t) the moment generating function


which is 6 lambda^3 / (lambda-t)(2lambda-t)(3lambda-t)..... but that's horrible in the end. 

But you could take the development above and claim that the CDF of the moximum of n independent exp. rand variable is the producte if the n individual CDFs

F_m(m) = Pi_k=1^n (1-exp(-m/mu_k))

still complicated. 

In quora:

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-distribution-of-the-maximum-of-n-Exponential-random-variables-each-with-a-different-mean

for a max of exp(-x) distributions


the moment generating function ....

Mean is sum_j=1^n (-1)^j (1/j) ((n j))
Second moment is

sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^j 1/j^2 (( n  j ))

where ((n j ))  = n!/(j!(n-j)!)  [the binomial coefficient]

but this is completely horribel to compute for a large sum. 

But the limiting distribution must be Gumbel


pdf of Gumbel is 1/beta * exp(-(z+e^-z)) [standard pour beta = 1 et mu = 0]

mean : mu + 0.577215669
variance = pi^2/6

The max ~ log(n) + Gumbell for exponential distributions (thus chi_sq (1) ) 

For Chi^2 distributions, I find of the order of 

mean ( Max ) ~ 2*( log(n) + 0.577215669) et
var  ( Max ) ~ 4 * pi/6

But I must verify that this ok.
