- make nicer graphs for mfft  <- in progress
- work on documentation
- document data and add astronomical data (documentation has to be revised for harmonic and pseudo_log)
- think more about the significance spectrum
- revis the haar bit
- revise the periodogram
- and make a paper ! 


- periodogram : MULTIPLY BY N^2 for power
- consider complex periodogram  
- add an option for working in arcsecond / kyr and harmonize MFFT units vs Periodogram. Attention: backward compatiblity will be killed. 

- for tone attribution: RAlgoCpp poses some problems. At least relegate to an option branch, authorise installation without it and if not installed just consider the function as unavailable. 

- mfft wast tested and gives very good results but I do not understand why. the basis of the Bi is not normalised and the norms do not correspond. There are some tricky mathematical compensation errors which I do not understand.
