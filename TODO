- make nicer graphs for mfft  <- in prgoress
- finalise computations for mfft_real_ter (use notebook) <- seems to be ok forfrequenices
- there still seems to be a bias on amplitudes that is not well corrected with the analytical methods, when there are several frequencies. As if the first components where eating a bit too much power. Not sure why, and not sure how to correct this. 
 But the bias is much less important with the complex version. So there must be a good mathematical reason that is not
 obvious to me (in mfft_complex not quite the same power goes in omega and -omega, so maybe the explanation is there ?)
- use that one only; deprecate mfft_real
- work on documentation
- and make a paper !
